### Part 2 (75 pts)


In this situation, it is key that I keep the security problems within the company.
If any of these issues are leaked to the outside, it would result in huge financial
and legal repercussions to the company. As a result, I would first discretely
present my findings to my colleagues. I must be sure that my findings are completely
valid before I go to my manager. Once I have agreement from my colleagues, I would
then present the problems to my boss, knowing that I have their support. Hopefully,
my boss would recognize the immediate concerns and postpone the ECU's release.
If my boss is unwilling to cooperate, I would bring my concerns one level higher
in the management hierarchy. However, if the company is completely unwilling to
postpone the ECU's release, I would go public with the issues. I would not
hesistate to do this because there are whistleblower laws that would protect me
in such circumstances where lives are in danger. This would be a last resort because
I would first try to do everything I can within the bounds of the company to address
the issues. If I were to do nothing, I would be indirectly responsible for any harm
that could arise from the security issues. I would never take those chances. If I can
save innocent lives, then I would do so without any hesitation. There is no
argument against postponing the release, even if it takes another six months. I 
would not care if I got fired because I would not want to work for a company that
values money or timelines over basic human safety.
